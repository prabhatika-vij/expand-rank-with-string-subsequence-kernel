# ExpandRank Algo Implementation with String Subsequence Kernel Similarity
The experiment was performed for 1000 documents from [Hulth2003](references/Improved_Automatic_Keyword_Extraction_Given_More_Linguistic_Knowledge_Annet_Hulth.pdf) dataset (Training), which is a collection of abstracts from different papers each with a set of associated human labelled keywords. For each document, a score was calculated and then the average of the score over those 1000 documents was used to see how well the algorithm works.The paper [Single Document Keyphrase Extraction Using Neighborhood Knowledge](references/Single_Document_Keyphrase_Extraction_Using_Neighborhood_Knowledge.pdf)

The dataset can be found at https://github.com/snkim/AutomaticKeyphraseExtraction
